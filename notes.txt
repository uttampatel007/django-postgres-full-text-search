# Full Text Search with Django + Postgres

## Full Text Search will search multiple fields, rank them by relevance and send them in particular order

## __search will work for only postgres with django [example: search = Video.objects.filter(title__search=q)]

## __search removes or ignores 'a' , 'and' , 'the' etc common words

## __search also consider python and pythons as same

## in vector we can add multiple fields

## search rank will return all objects after ranking them [not just search]
